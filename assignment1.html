        <p>I chose Shopify to model my site after. I like the way their home page is set up with sections. I would like to model my site off how the home page is a scroll section.</p>

        <p>My target audience is people who are fascinated or intrested in classic and psychadelic rock music. It also could be someone who has no knowledge of rock music at all but is interested. I do not think that there is a specifc age range as although the people who listened to the most Pink Floyd were those born in the 1950s-70s, younger people like me also enjoy listening to them and would like to know more about them since we grew up after thier era.</p>
